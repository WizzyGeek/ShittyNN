# ShittyNN

Aight I will tell you what this is, basically one day I thought to myself, How the fuck does mosquito with its tiny brain
know I am gonna slap it? so the goal of this repo, is to become smarter than a mosquito. From Scratch. And Pain. MAybe use cut some
corners coz you know mosquitoes are dumb??? maybe? who knows how smart they are, basically I will try to tell apart a green tennis ball
or something by the end of this.

I am making the code real shitty, real slow.
I try to come up with as much maths as I can, but I just read up on the hard shit.

## Goals
 - [ ] Detect two lists from a dataset of 3 using a perceptron
 - [ ] Detect a line on 16 * 16 using a perceptron
 - [ ] Make a nueral network which identifies vertical and horizontal lines

yah real low standards, I am going through pain dont laugh at my misery here.

## Inspiration

Basically explore efficiency of nueral nets, perceptrons and try and maybe come up with a method for training that i can understand and make
or just copy backpropagation i dunno if i am smart enough, but something simple doing plus and minus here and there should be enough

# Questions

## Why the name?

well, I would tell you to read the code, but i dont want you to get retinal cancer ü•∫.

## I have retinal cancer

Too bad, I warned you.

## Can I contribute?
    Yes, but you must explain every single thing you are doing if you know what you are doing to me, I am trynna learn here. pretty pls?

## Your cOdE SuCks.

You think i carE? fuck off

## I might be of help

If you think you can be of **any** help to me, please contact me on discord `WizzyGeek#2356` or https://discord.gg/udmdsFk6Yx
I appericiate any and all kind of support big or small, ranging from typos to just straight up helping me make
the next analog nueral network chip or something i dunno ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## When will this work?

Uhhhhhhh, as things are right now, uhh, Never. I think. Probably. Maybe. I dunno.
